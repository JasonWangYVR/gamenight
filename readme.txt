Current working status of Group 7 project - GameNight:
Currently running in Deployment mode

Please run python manage.py loaddata sample_fixture.json to load a sample fixture of the data

A large set of board game data has been scraped from BoardGameGeek, and display pages have been created and are under fine-tuning in /boardgames/

You may create a user and sign in, but we have yet to add site-wide links to allow for user registration/sign-in/log-out
Creation and editing of user groups has yet to be added

Events can be created, but the form is generated fairly generically, so datetime fields must be entered manually(which is not easy)
