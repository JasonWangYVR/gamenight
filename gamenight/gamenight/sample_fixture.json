Who will defeat the most heroes and rein supreme... from jail when they get caught because... well... Superheroes are awesome like that.&#10;&#10;Players get a hand of cards from which they will play or discard 2 per turn. For example minions, like Florence 'Hard Nut' McGee, could be placed on the field and players can start to create fiendishly clever weapons like the Poisonous Death Lamp. Alternatively they could play event cards such as the &quot;Publish a photo of your rival stroking a Kitten&quot; to reduce the fear gripping the city. Finally they could get bored and call up a Superhero to help the city... Then later use them for target practise. Superheroes start a set distance from the City and move closer after every round. If they reach the city they start to reduce the fear count which acts as the game timer.&#10;&#10;Reducing fear and calling up Superheroes nets players kudos worth VP's at the end but defeating Superheroes earns you Capes which are worth more VP's and after all you are Mostly Evil.&#10;&#10;",

The most important companies in Basel receive, assess, and acquire goods orders from the various cities located on or near the Rhine, and even as far away as London. Each order defines the destination and the number of containers, the delivery time, the agreed price, and the possible penalty.

    "description": "You're the leader of a great nation which is currently expanding. Over the course of the seven decades covered by the game, you will have to invest in infrastructures and industries, provide your country with energy and finance the mercurial forces of research in order to remain competitive.&#10;&#10;But prosperity has a price. You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?&#10;&#10;Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &ndash; energy and ecology &ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&#10;    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&#10;    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&#10;    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&#10;    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take money.&#10;    Remove one pollution marker.&#10;    Move forward one space on one research track.&#10;    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &euro;100, plus &euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &euro;50.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you'll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity. Whoever tallies the most prosperity points wins!&#10;&#10;",

But which one is the best? Which one knows the secrets of the transmutation like no other? Which one can use his influence in the city best to strengthen his position? And which one will be triumphant in the secret rituals known as &ldquo;chucking the dice&rdquo;?&#10;Let the competition begin and the council will elect the most successful alchemist as the new patriarch.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;In Alchemy Dice, the player start out with three different cards, three dice, an unique Character and an unique assortment of resources. During each round the players are rolling their dice and allocate them to their cards where they, based on the dice-roll will be able to use different actions - like collecting resources, modifying another die, tranforming one kind of resource into another one and so on.&#10;During the later phases of the game each player can use the collected resources to buy a new card and/or die which will improve his abilities during future rounds.&#10;&#10;The game can end in several ways (e.g. if all dice from 2 of the 4 dice markets have been bought, the last card from the deck has been drawn or one player has bought 8 cards) and the player with the most victory points (granted by the cards and through bonus conditions) wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Currently there are 2 versions of the game which will both be available through the Gamecrafter later this year:&#10;&#10;The Deluxe version:&#10;This version includes all the cards and all the other components needed to play the game.

The redux version comes in a small tuck-box and contains only the 56 cards and the rules. In order to play with this version who will have to provide your own dice, gems and markers. But as most people will have these things at hand already the redux version offers a very affordable way to get Alchemy Dice.&#10;&#10;",

The infighting among the city's major factions has only increased since war's end and the city itself faces utter destruction as the dangers of the surrounding wilderness grow. Without leadership the city will soon fall. There must be one who can unite the city under their leadership and restore order. You must be this one.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Allegiance: War of Factions, a collectible card game where each player takes the role of a lord or lady vying for control of a mighty city. Extend your influence in an attempt to control the city's major political, religious, and economic powers. While fighting for control, it may even be necessary to join forces with those who you would call your enemies as the city itself stands on the brink of being overrun by the denizens of the wild.&#10;&#10;So then, to which Factions will you make your call for support? House Mosfin? Is the strength of Droman Tregorian and his house sufficient to stand with on your way to dominance? Or would your ties to the Goddess Kalim better serve your efforts? Surely those who support the Glory of Kalim would recognize your true strength and the divine calling which Kalim, herself, has given you. Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues. Perhaps your call to them to follow you yet again into battle would give you the strength needed to claim control over the city. The decision is yours - but choose wisely who you would call friend, for in this trying time it is unsure where their allegiances lie.&#10;&#10;Allegiance: War of Factions introduces a unique system of play which allows everyone to become more involved in every phase of the game. Why sit back waiting for your enemies to make their move when you can stop them before they even get the chance? Form alliances, threaten your enemies, back-stab your friends, hoard the city's resources - the choice is yours!&#10;&#10;",

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Components for up to six players instead of five&#10;    Special two-player variant rules&#10;    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards&#10;    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.&#10;&#10;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://doris-frank.de/Games4.html&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hartmut Witt always has original game concepts, and he, along with Frank Schaubrenner, has created a fast-paced grab- and collecting-game that will thrill even expert speed-type game players. Rather unusual landscape types need to be crossed in this game: Clay flats, fields, hot sand, green lawns, water and cobblestones, even some rare blue-white or beige tiles. These landscapes are found on 28 large landscape cards, each of which again is made up of 18 landscape spaces, arranged in random fashion.&#10;&#10;The landscape cards get mixed up and distributed among the players (7 each with 3p and 4p, 8 with 2p - the rest go back in the box). Now, each player gets to set two particularly difficult cards aside and places the rest on the table to form a race circuit (the narrow sides of the cards are joined together). Thus, a different track with different challenges is created for each player. A goal card marks the goal for each player.&#10;&#10;Before the game can begin, 48 small cards are placed in the middle of the table as a face-down, spread out pile. Each card shows one of the landscape types mentioned above.&#10;&#10;As soon as the game starts, all players wildly grab through the pile of cards on the table. Cards, once revealed, are left face-up if they're not of immediate use. Cards that a player wants to keep are taken in hand. The order of the cards being collected, though, cannot be altered in any way. The collection phase ends when there's only face-up cards left on the table and a player calls &quot;stop&quot; because he thinks he has enough cards.&#10;&#10;Now, the players will see how far they get along their track with the cards they collected. The player who called &quot;stop&quot; starts. He turns the first card he collected over. If it's sand, for example, he puts his marker on a sand space at the start of his course. Thereafter, each subsequent card must show a landscape type that is next to the one his marker is on (either sideways, forwards or diagonally forwards) for him to move forwards. As soon as a card comes up that doesn't allow him to move his marker, his turn is over. Collected cards that are left over are put back into the middle of the table (face-down), and the figure stays where it managed to get to. Each player in turn order then does the same, moving their figure and returning leftover cards. Continue in this manner, round after round, until one player reaches the goal, ending the game. That player is of course the winner.&#10;&#10;Description of the game from Kosmos.&#10;&#10;",

That is, it&rsquo;s designed to look, feel and actually play like a nintendo classic.&#10;&#10;As with most video games, the goal is to defeat a &ldquo;FINAL BOSS&rdquo;. But with every hero aiming for the same goal, only one can actually go home with the glory. Players will battle against both in-game enemies and each other as they race to the final battle.&#10;&#10;Giant &ldquo;QUEST&rdquo; cards make up the board of Super Hazard Quest. Each card features a unique room in the adventure, complete with obstacles (or HAZARDS) that stand in a hero&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;ITEM&rdquo; cards, along with each hero&rsquo;s innate ability help them navigate from card to card. Whenever an unexplored part of the Quest is reached, a new Quest card is drawn from the deck and connected. Thus, the level builds as the heroes explore.&#10;&#10;Hidden among the Quest cards are boss rooms, including the game&rsquo;s Final Boss. But ordinary Items won&rsquo;t be enough. A SECRET CODE, well protected by other bosses, is the only weakness of the game&rsquo;s Final Boss. That said, heroes must first find a Boss, earn a Code and then be the first to reach the Final Boss. It&rsquo;s all the fun of multi-player retro gaming without ever having to blow into a cartridge!&#10;&#10;We are live on kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/949523363/super-hazard-quest&#10;&#10;",

One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!&#10;&#10;Customize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.&#10;&#10;Adapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!&#10;&#10;Sandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play, players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!&#10;&#10;Modding: Xia is very opened to modding, and the community created loads of stuff. See BGG's Unofficial Xia:LoaDS mods and expansions wiki.&#10;&#10;",

A &quot;base&quot; is captured the second time an opponent &quot;insect&quot; stop over it.&#10;Three 6-sided creature dice for every army are rolled every turn, and dictates which kinds of insects can move. When you lose a base, you lose a die and therefore some mobility. When you lose the second base, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;There are six armies, but only four were published in the United States. The game is sold in boxes containing two armies, and each army is separately available in two colors so identical forces can face each other:&#10;- USArthropods Vs. Flyborgs&#10;- Sovietoptera Vs. Chitinians&#10;- Samurachnids Vs. Bifids (not published in the US as of 8/2007)&#10;&#10;Each set has enough pieces for two players; by combining sets up to 12 can play.&#10;&#10;About special abilities: some insects can mimetize, some can move twice, other can shoot some weapons like missiles or acid spits (represented by winks, too)...&#10;&#10;BTW, the Italian name for &quot;Tiddlywinks&quot; is &quot;il gioco della pulce&quot;, which means &quot;the game of the flea&quot;.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Micro Mutants: Evolution&#10;&#10;",

For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Felinia is a mysterious continent, full of exotic riches! It&lsquo;s up to you to establish profitable trading posts, but beware: the competition is stiff.&#10;Alone or with a partner, hire a ship, fill its hulls full of refined merchandise, and set off to make yourself a fortune.&#10;&#10;Felinia is extremely interactive. It mixes an original bidding system with clever movement rules. Felinia is fascinating and addictive, for players new to games as well as confirmed masters.&#10;&#10;From the rule booklet:&#10;&#10;In the City of Katzburg, merchants are all discussing the big news. The mayor, Henry-Cat, has signed a trade agreement with the newly-discovered continent of Felinia. In exchange for precious goods (rare books, fine wines, precision watches, luxury clothing, and refined glassware), the Kingdoms of Felinia have agreed to let them install trading posts.&#10;&#10;Space is limited: You will have to act very quickly!&#10;&#10;Four ships have been chartered by the City to visit the five countries on Felinia. To board them, you must have a specific combination of merchandise provided by the markets of the City and requested by the leaders of Felinia. This also means you will have to earn money to be able to afford those purchases.&#10;&#10;The prices of the various merchandises are set by supply and demand, and can sometimes go very high! But it is the price you must pay to be on board one of the ships with hopes to establish a trading post on Felinia. Maybe you can collect gold and spices in the process!&#10;&#10;Each player represents a Family of Merchants whose goal is to have the highest prosperity at the time the last ship leaves Katzburg.&#10;&#10;Felinia is part three of &quot;The Gold Trilogy&quot; (besides The Golden City and Valdora)&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;&#10;     2012 Games 100 Nominee, Best Strategy Game.&#10;     Game by Game 2011, Recommendation&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In this fun take on alien invasion games, you get to choose whether you want to fight off alien forces as the army or whether you want be the aliens trying to conquer Earth.&#10;&#10;In the game, players roll dice to set their power &mdash; each army has one type of dice with six faces &mdash; so that they can destroy the other players' dice on a subsequent turn. Used dice are placed into an expended pile where they can later be rallied (re-rolled) to reset their power. Dice are ranked in power and can destroy any die of equal or lesser rank but the higher value dice have special abilities, e.g., Nukes on the Army side that destroy just about everything if you get three of them. On a player's turn, he has three options: (1) Attack with an existing die, (2) Rally any or all dice (including active ones) or (3) Use a special power.&#10;&#10;If five rounds pass without either player scoring, then the game ends and the player who has the most dice in his scoring zone wins.&#10;&#10;",

Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&#10;&#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&#10;&#10;&quot;The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.&quot; - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)  &#10;Evolution was covered in the journal, Nature.

But with a myriad of hazards lying in wait, once you enter the pyramid you might never come out.&#10;&#10;Descend into an ancient Egyptian pyramid with The Adventurers: The Pyramid of Horus, a standalone board game of danger and exploration for 2-6 players.

    "description": "Two spice dealers share a storehouse with a number of hungry rats, who want to put them out of business.  The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.&#10;&#10;All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.&#10;&#10;The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.&#10;&#10;The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.&#10;&#10;When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.&#10;&#10;The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.&#10;&#10;Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.&#10;&#10;Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

The players are investigators within that world, each attempting to understand the facts of a series of strange occurrences.&#10;&#10;These facts are made up of 6 different types of evidence, each of which could turn out to be pertinent, irrelevant, or unknowable. Each round, a set of facts is put aside, and the players must then attempt to deduce those facts (or, if necessary, make their best guess).&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the player who can identify the most facts without getting any wrong will learn a Terrible Truth about the world. The first to learn 3 Terrible Truths wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Build it to save as many humans as you can and launch your spaceship to the nearest exoplanet before the supernova.&#10;&#10;Constructing your ship is only half the game. For those that survive the solar event and launch their ships, they must face new challenges on the way to our new exoplanet home, Earth 667C. The Journey to the new planet has boosts and perils along the way, including black holes, quasars, enemy vessels, and asteroid fields.

Will you be the first to Earth 667C?&#10;&#10;Earth 667C is a card and turn-based tabletop game for 2-6 players or teams. Perfect for ages 10 and up, the game is fun, encourages strategic thinking, and includes just enough chance and player relationship dynamics to create three game phases with unique challenges.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Ship Building&#10;Purchase Ship Components from Space Dock, and construct the fastest ship carrying the most people. Customize your ship by doubling your navigation for better travel. Double your engineering department for increased speed. Or, add more food and life support to increase your capacity to carry survivors. Pick your strategy for your ship and start building. Optional Ship Components are available for purchase. Components like weapon systems, shuttle bays, and radiation shield provide bonuses or protection during The Journey.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Launch Your Ship&#10;When the Solar Cycle hits 8, you can launch your fully constructed spaceship. Roll the dice and aim for 12 or higher to push your ship into position for The Journey. Get 12 or lower? Then you must wait, and hope that the solar clock does not tick down any further. You must launch your ship before the clock hits zero, and the sun goes supernova.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: The Journey&#10;When the clock hits zero and sun engulfs the Earth, the real Journey begins. Play a single turn journey, or an eight turn journey. Roll the dice and discover what boosts and perils await you while traveling to humanity's new exoplanet home. Encounter new enemies that attack and slow your ship, or pass a strong hydrogen cloud that boosts your engines. Utilize your optional Ship Components to ward off enemies or discover wormholes to increase your speed. This phase will put your ship building skills to the test. The events during The Journey can slow the fastest ship, and propel others to victory.&#10;&#10;Be the first ship with the most survivors to reach Earth 667C and ensure the survival of the human race on our new exoplanet home!&#10;&#10;",

A round house is a large, multi-floor, enclosed, and fortified earth building housing usually a whole clan, which functions as a village and is known as &quot;a little kingdom for the family&quot;.&#10;&#10;In the game Round House, players are the head of a family who tries to lead their members to glory. Players take turns moving their pawns around the circular building in one direction, performing different actions to get goods, trade goods for money, hire experts, send family members for distant business, and eventually bring the families home to worship the ancestors. By cleverly moving your pawns around the round house and maximizing the performance of your faithful family members, you might become the most glorious family and win the game!&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player either lays one card face up in front of him &ndash; thereby openly showing a stock in a particular type of good &ndash; or plays 1-4 cards of the same spice onto a market. Once a market has a type of goods on it, only goods of the same type can be added to it. No market can have more than four cards on it, and the same good can by played into at most two markets. The player then refills his hand to seven cards.&#10;&#10;When all the markets have cards in them or two markets are full with four cards, the round ends. Each player reveals his secret stock; for each stock card that has a market devoted to it, the player scores 1-10 points, depending on the type of spice and the number of cards in the market. A player can score an identical spice card only if two markets carry this spice.&#10;&#10;Players clear the markets, then begin a new round. The player with the most points after four rounds wins!&#10;&#10;",

Over six years of harvests, cultivate your vines, choose the best varieties, hire the best oenologists, take part in trade fairs, and show your opponents you are the best winemaker in the game.&#10;&#10;The players, winemakers in Portugal, will develop their vineyards and produce wine to achieve maximum profit.&#10;The object of the game is to produce quality wines that can be exchanged for money or victory points.&#10;The best wines are then sent to a wine fair in order to achieve fame and win awards.&#10;&#10;Awake your senses and have fun making and selling your own wine.&#10;&#10;From back of Box Cover:&#10;&#10;In Vinhos (a Portuguese word meaning &ldquo;Wines&rdquo;) you will play the role of wine producers in Portugal.&#10;&#10;Over a period of 6 years, you will expand your business by establishing Estates in the different regions of Portugal, buying vineyards and building wineries.

The game is easy to learn and provides a vivid atmosphere with lots of laughter.&#10;&#10;To prepare the game, a plastic disk is placed in the centre of the table and each player marks one of his hands &quot;true&quot; and the other &quot;false&quot; (or one can say that the right hand is &quot;true&quot; and the left hand is &quot;false&quot;).&#10;&#10;In a turn, a question is read out loud and all the players have to answer with &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as fast as possible, using their hands. For instance, if the answer is &quot;true&quot;, one places his right hand on the plastic disk, as such creating a pile of hands on top of the disk. Please mind that the answer to the question might vary as a function of the number of players, the players itself, etc (see below). Mind that once you've put your hand, you cannot change your answer anymore.&#10;&#10;Once all players have answered the question, i.e. have placed one of their hands on the pile of hands, scoring begins. The upper hand scores +1 point if its answer is correct or -1 point if its answer is incorrect. The second hand (from the top) will score +2 if its answer is correct or -2 if its answer is incorrect, and so on. For instance, in a 8 player game, the lower hand (on the plastic disk) scores +8 points for a correct answer or -8 points for an incorrect answer.&#10;&#10;Players really have to take risks to improve their score, answering quickly and so having their hand smashed.&#10;&#10;To give you an idea of the questions, there are several types:&#10;Concerning the reader of the question (I am a man)&#10;Concerning the player (You have a dog)&#10;Concerning the environment/location (We play in a bar)&#10;General questions (King Kong was an ape)&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has scored a specific number of points, e.g. 30 points in a 8 player game.&#10;&#10;Additional rules for some variations are included (like changing hands and playing in teams).&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Hand aufs Herz&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Queue) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty.&#10;&#10;The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as &quot;Mother carrying small child&quot;, &quot;This is not your place, sir&quot;, or &quot;Under-the-counter goods&quot;. But they have to watch out for &quot;Closed for stocktaking&quot;, &quot;Delivery error&quot;, and for the black pawns &ndash; the speculators &ndash; standing in the queue. Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags.&#10;&#10;On the product cards are photos of sixty original objects from the Communist era. The merchandise includes Relaks shoes, Przemys&#197;&#130;awka eau de cologne, and Popularna tea, as well as other commodities that were once in scarce supply. The neighborhood also has an outdoor market but the prices there are steep &ndash; unless, of course, you manage to strike a deal with the market trader. In this realistic game you really have to be savvy to get the goods.&#10;&#10;Are you brave enough to confront the everyday life of the 1980s?&#10;&#10;",

The game features a modular board for players to explore, 48 distinct advances, seven mighty wonders, and loads of miniatures and cards. The winner will create a culture that will be remembered and admired for millennia.&#10;&#10;Advances&#10;The game features about 48 distinct advances. The whole &quot;tech-tree&quot; is very flexible with no dead ends, yet still intuitive, sensible and &quot;realistic.&quot; Additionally you have a great overview of what advances other cultures have - no need to ask - just look.&#10;&#10;Modular Board&#10;Players start with a civilization in its infancy. Move settlers to uncharted regions and reveal the terrain and its resources. Several mechanisms have been implemented to assure that an unlucky placement of region-tiles won't be a decider.&#10;&#10;Playing Time&#10;The game covers a time span similar to AH Civilization - that is to pre-gunpowder. This epic game is playable in about an hour per player!

As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.&#10;&#10;Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)&#10;&#10;- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic&#10;How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.&#10;&#10;- Comic Book Included&#10;The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game. Objective cards that match the Comic continue the story as you play the game.&#10;&#10;- Game Soundtrack &#10;Listen to the official game soundtrack on your computer or smart phone.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.&#10;&#10;",

It now play 1-4 players and consists of numerous Heroes and Henchmen to choose from to delve in the dungeon below. Here are some game highlights.&#10;&#10;1)Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&#10;&#10;2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&#10;&#10;3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!&#10;&#10;4)No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.&#10;&#10;",

Its quickly expanding trade and exports to close cities were great opportunities for the local businessmen to expand their riches.&#10;&#10;Take on the role of an ambitious merchant during this golden era of trade. The task set before you is to become the most successful entrepreneur in the city of Constantinopolis. Compete against your rivals and earn the most renown by completing contracts and establishing viable trade; your fame will be measured by your ability to expand your trade district while managing your delivery contracts.&#10;&#10;Constantinopolis is a board game of resource management, economy, and trade for 2-5 players. With a moderate game time of 1 to 2 hours and intuitive rules, Constantinopolis strikes the perfect balance of accessibility and depth.&#10;&#10;Tiles in Latin, consistent with Giustiniano's time, are both a reference to the high period of Constantinopolis and a way to make the game entirely language independent.&#10;&#10;",

The rows have a large store at either end called kalah. &#10;A player owns the six pits closest to him and the kalah on his right side. &#10;Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game becomes more and more challenging by starting with 4, 5 or up to 6 seeds in each pit. Today, 4 seeds per pit has become the most common variant, but Champion recommended the expert game with 6.&#10;&#10;Play is counterclockwise. The seeds are distributed one by one in the pits and the players own kalah, but not into the opponent's store.&#10;&#10;If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured.&#10;If the last seed falls into the player's kalah, he must move again.&#10;If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, he captures all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in his kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of his holes. The remaining pieces are captured by his adversary. The player who has captured most pieces is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The game went on to win the Best Strategic Card Game Award at the UK Games Expo 2013, along with Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles players use hands of 6 units, drawn from their total 'army' of 36 cards, playing one card per turn at the start of their turn.&#10;&#10;Cards have unique formations of Attack Arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played, and the damage they will do. Some cards also have Ranged Attack values. Each card then has a Defence value which, when exceeded by attacking cards, sees that card defeated.&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from their army deck to return their hand back up to 6 or retreat a unit that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies - the Orcs and the Dwarves.&#10;&#10;These factions are differentiated by their exclusive cards and strategies; the Dwarf faction plays more defensively, using some Ranged cards and powerful Berserker units to pick-off assailants, while the Orc army encourages players to attack more vigorously, often committing kamikaze moves to their tactical advantage.&#10;&#10;Orcs versus Dwarves is cross-compatible with Elves versus Lizardmen, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict Ranking System, to create Mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to form her signature pattern on the board twice without wilds and with her special symbol scores maximum points.&#10;&#10;Players seeking more of a challenge can compete in &quot;Rock Garden&quot;, in which players receive twelve &quot;rock&quot; cubes and play them on sets of tiles matching their pattern tiles. Place all of your rocks first to win.&#10;&#10;",

Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them &ndash; but the profit is unbelievable.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points.&#10;&#10;",

Cardinal Richelieu is centralizing power in the name of King Louis XIII and defends France against those he considers its enemies: the English, the protestants, the Habsburgs and French nobles scheming against him and the crown. Will you side with the cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the queen and foreign nations? Be warned that the cardinal will hinder too ambitious intrigants. Become an influent noble in the court by accumulating prestige and favors. The player most helpful to each faction is also rewarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Richelieu is a tactical game with a lot of bluff and interaction, with intrigue everywhere. Every instance of intrigue will pit Cardinal Richelieu against his enemies. The players are nobles taking sides in these intrigues by placing agents with secret values and thus influencing the intrigues. Will you choose to side with Richelieu or the conspirators &ndash; or perhaps even help both? You can keep your support secret or make it directly known to others when placing your agents at the intrigues. It costs money to place agents, but the winning faction gives higher rewards for the players that helped them the most.&#10;&#10;The Cardinal's mood is influenced by his success or failures, and he will become intolerant against too influential nobles (i.e. the players), who will have one fewer action to spend during a turn as a result.&#10;&#10;There are many possibilities and opportunities to score points for the player who foresees and thwarts the plans of other players. During the game, you will constantly have to choose your side: Will you side with the Cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the Queen and from foreign nations?&#10;&#10;Winner of Plateau d'or 2009!&#10;&#10;",

Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.&#10;&#10;Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game situations: With more than 200 playing cards, the challenges and threats are different each time you play.&#10;     Game mode: You can play a single mission, a campaign or a scenario; each game mode has its own level and duration, and you're advised to start with a single mission on the lowest level (green).&#10;     Level up: Did you succeed a few times on level green? If so, you might want to try the next (orange) level or even a scenario, that is, three missions in a row with increasing difficulty!&#10;     Goals: Even players' goals can be altered. Countdown: Special Ops is a co-operative game, but if you'd like to change the rules, you could add one or two traitors to the team and play &quot;Traitor Mode&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Development&#10;You can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...&#10;&#10;This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission &quot;feel&quot; like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.&#10;&#10;",

If a project's requirements are met the player places the completed project in his score pile. &#10;When hiring, a player takes an advanced filmmaker into his hand from the advance row by discarding another filmmaker of the same specialty. Advance filmmakers have multiple skills and special abilities.  &#10;Using the recast action, a player can draw a new card from his deck by discarding any one card from his hand.&#10;The four types of projects have different requirements. &#10;Movies need skills, based on their difficulty. Tv series need a defined number of skills while excluding some in particular. Commercials need specialties, not specific skills, whereas awards need exactly the skills shown on them and nothing more. Finally, there is also the trilogy in which all players can place filmmakers in secret during the course of the whole game and gain fame at the end according to the skills played.&#10;&#10;After a project is completed it is replaced by a new one from the upcoming projects pile. When the pile is depleted, players play a last round before the era is completed. The game ends after four eras and the final scoring occurs.&#10;&#10;It is a light to medium game, equally suited for families and gamers, and is recommended for players 12 years old and up. Two to four players can have the unique experience of managing a movie studio and each game lasts about forty minutes.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Kabuki features the same gameplay as Illusion, but players now try to track the different face paintings worn by kabuki artists.&#10;&#10;",

King Dalian has claimed the swamp&rsquo;s treasures for his Free City of Temmen and now calls for the eradication of the Briarlights. The city&rsquo;s most skilled and prestigious guildhall will be awarded a Royal Warrant and the right to the riches of the Alderswamps for the Crown.&#10;&#10;Even now, the Briarlights are swimming across the brown waters of the Alderswamps to attack the city. And there are many other less obvious dangers that plague the King&rsquo;s lands. As your guild&rsquo;s greatest and shrewdest mind, it is up to you how your time will be spent. Build relationships, gather resources, make discoveries and lay the foundations to win the King&rsquo;s Royal Warrant.&#10;&#10;When the last Briarlight is chased out, the riches of the Alderswamps will be yours to claim.&#10;&#10;In Guild Masters, you lead one of the esteemed guilds of the Free City of Temmen competing to earn the favor of the king. You&rsquo;ll craft items for eager heroes to recruit them to your guild and earn a share of the treasure from their quests.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over two ages, and in each age, you will be gathering resources, crafting items, hiring workers, and building new rooms in your guild to earn prestige. At the end of the second age, the king arrives in Temmen to judge all of the guilds. The player with the most prestige is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn you take one action: gathering resources, crafting items to sell to adventurers, or building new rooms and hiring workers for your guild. Players take turns one at a time until the king arrives and signals the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Top Trumps has been a very popular card game in the United Kingdom since the seventies. There are many different card decks with various subject matter, i.e. Cars, Planes, Films, Military Jets, famous TV shows, etc...&#10;&#10;Top Trumps are now also available in the USA, based on the classic card game &quot;War&quot;, it's played by choosing your best stat, trumping (beating) your opponent&rsquo;s card, and winning the entire deck.&#10;&#10;Each pack of Top Trumps consists of a number of cards (usually 30 or 32), each of which features in-game characters based on related subject matter which are full of stats, pictures and educational and interesting facts. The game is multiplayer and fits handily in the pocket so it can be played anywhere.&#10;&#10;2-6 people can play. Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may ONLY look at their top card.&#10;&#10;The player to go first chooses the &lsquo;best&rsquo; statistic (usually the highest) from their top card, e.g. &ldquo;Top Speed 252mph&rdquo;. All other players read out the SAME statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.&#10;&#10;During a round, if 2 or more cards &lsquo;tie&rsquo; or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side.&#10;&#10;The first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;Latest Packs available in the USA include - Royal Wedding Top Trumps, Moshi Monsters, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, US Presidents, US States, New York City, Marvel Ultimate Heroes, Soccer Stars and Soccer Stadiums, Greek Mythology, US Army, G.I. Joe, Ice Age, Transformers 2, Bugs, Baby Animals, Horses &amp; Ponies, Star Wars, Clone Wars, Indiana Jones, James Bond, The Simpsons, Doctor Who, NBA 2010, Bugs, Dinosaurs 2010, Predators 2010, The Dog, Wildlife and Sealife In Danger, Military Jets, Ancient Egypt, and DC Super Heroes 1 and 2. As well as Star Wars and Marvel Top Trumps Tournament games.&#10;&#10;The more familiar you are with the deck the better since you will gain from knowing what particular cards have a superior statistic compared to other cards. This adds a memory factor to the game. The cards have pictures of the subject matter and are packed with statistics and facts, and can also help improve on reading, math, and social skills.&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a. quartets.&#10;&#10;",

By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&#10;&#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&#10;&#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution. Final scores are for connected taxis and for having least/most pollution.&#10;&#10;",

Why don't the gods put an end to this macabre circus? Why does Xelor himself turn a blind eye to the demons' meddling with time's delicate web? Well, you may ask, but it is not for us mortals to know the minds of the gods.&#10;&#10;Krosmaster: Arena is a player-vs-player, tactical card game with anime-style miniatures that offers the craftiest tacticians among you the chance to challenge other players to heated battles in arenas scattered around Hormonde. All players build their team using a pre-determined method, whether a point system, draft, or at random. Equip your team with spells, weapons and other items adapted to their requirements, then utilize their various talents and abilities to create a powerful fighting force. Every figure has a point value attached to it to help balance things out. Randomly drawn event cards spice up the game at each turn, and the winning conditions differ for each game based on the scenario you choose to play. Only those who are able to create a strong, yet versatile, strategy will prevail!&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: Events can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;",

Each card allows a player to play the components shown on it, with the wall deck cards always depicting at least one wall (and some combination of walls/towers) and the tower deck cards always depicting at least one tower (and again some combination of walls/towers). On a turn, a player can play as many cards as she wants, but she draws only one card at the end of her turn. The goal is to create courtyards &ndash; and subdivide existing courtyards &ndash; while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Players have the same cards in their decks, so the challenge is all about what to use when. The game ends when all the castle pieces are used up, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Two different pairs of Keep colors are available in the two versions of Castellan, so with two copies of the game &ndash; and the right combination of bits &ndash; up to four players can play.&#10;&#10;",

America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:&#10;         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;    &#10;     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East&#10;     110 Strategy Cards&#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)&#10;     Two Player Reference Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;",

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;",

On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.  Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart.  Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game.  The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Airlines&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Airlines Europe&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel&#10;&#10;Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed Corporation player then takes their turn with both Doomtroopers and the next Corporation token is flipped.  Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).  After all Corporations have taken their turns it is the Dark Legion players turn.&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.&#10;&#10;",

All over the land, people are vying to find a patron, one of the rich noble families who will support and encourage a creative soul with their wealth, fame, and good name.&#10;&#10;One of the members of these illustrious nobility is looking for a fresh, young mind to carry into the halls of history.  To find the best and brightest, the Patron has organized a challenge.  All geniuses should seek to emulate the greatest man of their time, Leonardo da Vinci, and therefore, the most worthy artist will be the one who can turn Leonardo&rsquo;s dreams into reality.&#10;&#10;As one of the Patron&rsquo;s hopeful aspirants, you have been invited to one of daVinci&rsquo;s private laboratories, to compete against other artists in their goal to follow in the late Master&rsquo;s footsteps.  Your job is to maneuver around the puzzle that is daVinci&rsquo;s lab, traversing the rotating gears of his workshop, all the while assembling a team of expert engineers to study and be the first to build a replica of one of da Vinci&rsquo;s designs.  The first recruit to successfully assemble and test the proposed machine will win the coveted spot in the Patron&rsquo;s household.  Do you have what it takes to win?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to move around a moving gear board, with each gear offering up a different resource for your build - plans, engineers, tools, and materials.  The plans tell the players what other resources they need to collect.  Plans are played with cards, engineers and tools are played on tokens (so they can be left on a board location), and materials are played with shards.&#10;&#10;Once a player has all of the resources necessary to complete his build, they can move on to the final gear to assemble their creations, and then return to the beginning of the room.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Website...&#10;&#10;&quot;Monster Quest is a fun and exciting game, with nine years of play testing by fantasy gamers. If you like dungeons and a dragon or two than you will love a game of Monster Quest. The game doesn't take days or weeks to prepare it's ready to go in minutes right out of the box. Monster Quest is a mythological board game that leads a player through a magical land of action and adventure. Monster Quest has 226 spaces on the board and 450 cards.  There are Spell cards, Wisdom cards, Map cards, Monster cards, and even Property cards that can be bought during the game.  The cards are one of the ways that a player develops their character.  Also, the cards give the player the ability to move about the land of Monster Quest rather than relying solely on the chance of the dice.&#10;&#10;There are 12 different parts to the game-board, a main trail that connects all of the different parts of the game-board together, a Town Adventure, a Dungeon, six Inner trails, and three Outer trails.&#10;&#10;Each player has a pegboard to keep track of their Hit Points (HP), Armor Class (AC), Platinum Pieces (PP), Gold Pieces (GP), Silver Pieces (SP), Jewels, and the Experience (Exp.) that a player will gain during the game.&#10;&#10;Monster Quest uses two sets of dice, two six-sided and two eight-sided.  The dice are used to Battle Monsters, win treasure, and move about the land of Monster Quest.&#10;&#10;A game of Monster Quest can last anywhere from three to five hours depending on the level of difficulty you wish to play.  Monster Quest can be played by two to four players.  There are six jewels in the game protected by monsters; a player must collect all six jewels to win the game.  Monster Quest is a whole world on one board where strategy is key.&#10;&#10;Beyond the City Gate treasure awaits in dark Caves, along Wooded Trails through the Emerald Forest on Shipyard Docks across the Black Sea to thirst in the Desert wandering the Foothills to the Mountains of Doom on your way to the King?s Castle to save the Princess.

    "description": "Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe &mdash; which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.&#10;&#10;As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&#10;&#10;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&#10;&#10;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.&#10;&#10;",
